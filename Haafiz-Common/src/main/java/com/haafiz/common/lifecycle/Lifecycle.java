/**
 * Lifecycle state. Allows the following transitions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>INITIALIZED -&gt; STARTED, STOPPED, CLOSED</li>
 * <li>STARTED     -&gt; STOPPED</li>
 * <li>STOPPED     -&gt; STARTED, CLOSED</li>
 * <li>CLOSED      -&gt; </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Also allows to stay in the same state. For example, when calling stop on a component, the
 * following logic can be applied:
 * <pre>
 * public void stop() {
 *  if (!lifecycleState.moveToStopped()) {
 *      return;
 *  }
 * // continue with stop logic
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The Lifecycle class is thread-safe. It is also possible to prevent concurrent state transitions
 * by locking on the Lifecycle object itself. This is typically useful when chaining multiple transitions.
 * <p>
 * Note, closed is only allowed to be called when stopped, so make sure to stop the component first.
 * Here is how the logic can be applied. A lock of the {@code lifecycleState} object is taken so that
 * another thread cannot move the state from {@code STOPPED} to {@code STARTED} before it has moved to
 * {@code CLOSED}.
 * <pre>
 * public void close() {
 *  synchronized (lifecycleState) {
 *      if (lifecycleState.started()) {
 *          stop();
 *      }
 *      if (!lifecycleState.moveToClosed()) {
 *          return;
 *      }
 *  }
 *  // perform close logic here
 * }
 * </pre>
